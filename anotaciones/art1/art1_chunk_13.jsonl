{"id":13,"text":"The performance of ChatGPT-4 ( 95. 5 % ) and Gemini ( 94. 0 % ) in the breast cancer reconstruction challenge is contrasted in the graph. Although both models perform well, ChatGPT-4 performs somewhat better than Gemini, suggesting that it is significantly more successful in terms of relevance or accuracy for this particular task. The relevance ratings of these models are graphically contrasted in the graph, emphasizing how well they perform in breast cancer reconstruction tasks. 4. 1. 3. Time for Response The time it takes for an AI model to receive an input or query and produce an output or result is referred to as response time. In clinical situations, when making decisions quickly can be crucial, this is signif icant. The formula for response time is given in Equation. Response Time = End Time −Start Time Total Response Where, End Time is the timestamp when the AI generates the output, Start Time is the timestamp when the AI starts processing the input, and Total Responses is the total number of responses the model needs to handle. In clinical contexts, shorter periods are better since they allow for quicker decision-making. The graphical visualization of response time is represented in The response time of Gemini ( 2. 4 s ) and ChatGPT-4 ( 2. 5 s ) for breast cancer reconstruction are shown in the graph. Both models operate equally ; however, the small response time difference indicates that Gemini is a bit faster. While the response time analysis shows a slight advantage for Gemini ( 2. 4 s compared to ChatGPT-4 ′ s 2. 5 s ), the impact on real-world clinical workflows remains uncertain. In practical settings, such small differ ences may not significantly affect the overall decision-making process, as both models provide response quickly. However, in high pressure environments where speed is critical, even minimal improvements in response time could enhance efficiency, suggesting that Gemini could offer a slight edge in time-sensitive situations. 4. 2. Comparison with existing Compared with NLP, both ChatGPT-4 and Gemini demonstrate marked improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score was provided in and Moreover, AUROC comparisons further underscore the competitive performance of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, with Gemini showing a slight edge. The AUROC graph in illustrates the comparative performance of the two models.
