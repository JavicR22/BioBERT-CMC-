{"id":14,"text":"closer to the top-left corner, demonstrating superior performance in distinguishing between positive and negative cases. Real world application : ChatGPT-4 and Gemini exhibit distinct strengths in real-world applications. Gemini ’ s advanced multimodal capabilities enable seamless integration of text, images, and other data formats, making it particularly effective in tasks like multimodal searches and intelligent assistance. In contrast, ChatGPT-4 excels in text-based applications, demonstrating high versatility in coding, writing, and brainstorming. Both models contribute significantly to various do mains, with their unique features catering to specific user needs. 4. 3. Error metrics In addition to the overall performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, an error breakdown offers a deeper analysis, revealing specific strengths and weaknesses of the models. By analyzing the confusion matrix, the occurrence of false positives ( FP ), false negatives ( FN ), and other key error metrics can be understood better, providing a clearer view of how ChatGPT-4 and Gemini perform in predicting patient re covery outcomes during breast cancer reconstruction. the confusion matrix diagrams that visually represent the classification performance of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. 4. 4. Analysing performance by demographic subgroups Another important aspect is to assess how the models perform across various demographic subgroups such as age. This analysis helps in Relevance comparisons between ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. Response time comparisons with ChatGTP-4 and Gemini.

Zheng 8 identifying potential biases or inconsistencies in model predictions. Results were given in and graphical representation was provided in Age : Gemini shows consistent performance across different age groups, accurately predicting recovery outcomes for both younger and older patients. ChatGPT-4, while effective, shows slightly lower recall in older populations, indicating it may miss more true recovery cases in this group. 4. 5.
