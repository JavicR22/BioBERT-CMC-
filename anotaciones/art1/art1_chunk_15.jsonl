{"id":15,"text":"Results were provided in Based on the SHAP feature importance analysis, the Gemini Model outperforms the ChatGPT Model by offering better feature interactions, higher interpretability, and more clinically meaningful insights. This makes Gemini a more suitable choice for medical decision support systems. 5. Discussion Enhanced patient-specific recovery outcomes in breast cancer reconstruction by developing a predictive framework that utilizes NLP and LLM. This framework ’ s ability to use LLMs like ChatGPT-4 and Gemini for predictive modeling is a significant improvement. Prior to NLP and LLMs, recovery assessments needed manual data processing, depended on generic plans, and lacked predictive accuracy. Patient in sights and psychosocial variables were unusual and unnoticed. The Comparison using various metrics. AUROC comparison for ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. Confusion matrix for ( a ) ChatGPT-4 and ( b ) Gemini. Performance metrics comparison by demographic subgroups. Performance Metric ChatGPT-4 Gemini Accuracy 97 % 97. 5 % Precision 95. 5 % 96. 8 % Recall 96 % 97 % F1-Score 95. 75 % 96. 9 % Performance results. C. Zheng 9 proposed technique enhances breast cancer reconstruction and offers individualized treatment and precise recovery predictions by integrating NLP and LLMs. Problems and rehabilitation strategies were predicted and enhanced by clinicians with the help of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, which offer AI-driven insights. Finally, this method improves outcomes and quality of life by empowering patients with customized recovery programs and encouraging improved decision-making. Medical practice and computation healthcare, including its researches, were developed by it, which will help in doing better patient centered care. While the research highlights the effectiveness of LLMs like ChatGPT-4 and Gemini in generating predictive insights for breast cancer reconstruction, it acknowledges the importance of explain ability in clinical adoption. The framework relies on performance metrics such as accuracy, score per response, and readability to ensure that recommendations are clear and reliable. However, for clinician trust, the models provide consistent and easily understandable outputs, with Gemini showing higher readability scores ( 94. 5 % ) and reliability in performance ( lower standard devia tion ). The models ’ explanations and outputs, though not fully trans parent in terms of decision-making processes, aim to provide high-","label":[[503,512,"MODEL"],[844,853,"MODEL"],[893,902,"MODEL"],[997,1006,"MODEL"],[1390,1399,"MODEL"],[1811,1820,"MODEL"],[105,112,"MODEL"],[503,510,"MODEL"],[844,851,"MODEL"],[893,900,"MODEL"],[997,1004,"MODEL"],[1390,1397,"MODEL"],[1811,1818,"MODEL"],[2396,2401,"MODEL"],[702,710,"METRIC"],[1014,1022,"METRIC"],[2024,2032,"METRIC"],[1036,1045,"METRIC"],[1062,1068,"METRIC"],[1079,1087,"METRIC"]],"Comments":[]}
