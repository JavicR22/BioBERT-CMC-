Research organization The following is the sequence in which the research is structured : Section 2 explains related works involving NLP and LLM models. A detailed summary of the systems utilized in the recommended method is given in Section 3. Furthermore, Section 4 offers the outcomes of the ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. Results of implemented models and limitations before the model ’ s implementation are conferred in Section 5. Finally, the research ’ s conclusion, and future workare determined in Section 6. 2. Literature review The reduction of incidence of post-mastectomy lymphedema ( PML ) after axillary lymphadenectomy ( AL ) was performed by implementing a randomized Clinical Experiment ( RCE ) on the efficacy of theprimary lymphatic repair ( PLR ) method. PLR reduced PML incidence ( 9. 5 % vs. 32 %, p = 0. 014 ) and improved lymphatic function, bioimpedance, andcompression use. The blinding and the use of an arbitrary 10 % RVC cutoff for diagnosing lymphedema should be improved. The assessment of decisional conflict in patients weighing immediate breast recon struction revealed that 68 % faced clinically significant decisional conflict, especially among those with a lower reconstruction preference and greater anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed, which producedrestrictions such as a sample composed of individuals with high levels of education and the possibility of over estimating decisional conflict. The effect of radiation dose on complica tions in breast cancer patients were analyzed. In addition, major post-radiation therapy complications were found in 7. 6 % of patients. The dependence on reviews of medical charts and differences in follow-up durations among institutions should be reduced. Assessment on surgical outcomes, complications, regional recur rence, and reserved metastases in patients was analyzed who received autologous fat attaching following breast cancer surgery. The STROBE ( Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ) procedures were established, revealing a 1. 1 % rate of local recurrence, a 2. 2 % incidence of distant metastases, a 1. 1 % tumor-related mortality rate, and a 67. 12 % patient satisfaction level regarding autologous fat grafting.
