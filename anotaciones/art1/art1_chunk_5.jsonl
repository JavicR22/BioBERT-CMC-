The depiction on lipofilling within breast reconstruction, patient satisfaction, and an examination of existing literature were performed. The method was described in a multi-center retrospective cohort analysis conducted from 2013 January to 2020 of April. Data from 37 patients indicated an 18. 9 % complication rate and a 5. 4 % recurrence rate. The retrospective nature of the research showed that some biases cannot be excluded. The clinical facets and determinants linked to local recurrence ( LR ) following immediate breast reconstruction ( IBR ) were elucidated. Invasive cancers had a 7-year LR rate of 4. 3 %, with survival rates in LR cases being lower ( 92. 5 % compared to 97. 3 % ). The retrospective design, along with differing institutional criteria for patient selection and postoperative treatments, may introduce biases. A novel surgical approach calledminimally invasive nipple-sparing mastectomy ( MI-NSM ) combined with directimplant subpectoral breast reconstruction was deployed, aiming for improved outcomes. The thirty procedures exhibited minimal complications, a high level of patient satisfaction, along with average surgical durations of 179 min ( for unilateral cases ) and 271 min ( for bilateral cases ). Patients with grade II and above ptotic breasts were not suitable candidates for this surgical technique. Thehazardfeatures for difficulties arising from breast reconstruction in patients over sixty years of age were analyzed. The method involved a retrospective chart review of 309 patients. Complications necessitating reoperation occurred in 26. 7 % of patients, with significant complications associated with ipsilateral BCT and chemotherapy. In women older than 60 years, breast reconstruction was not linked to increased rates of major complications. To determine women who had an implant reconstruction after a cancer-directed mastectomy for any breast tumor, a retrospective anal ysis was conducted on patient records. The technique employed was anaplastic T-cell lymphoma ( ATCL ). Throughout 421, 223 person-years, 5 instances of breast ATCL were identified, resulting in an observed incidence rate of 11. 9 per million individuals annually. Limi tations encompass the retrospective investigation of office data, which relies on precise reporting.
