Data preprocessing The preprocessing of data for NLP tasks is similar to that of early rule-based systems, involving procedures such as lemmatization as well as stemming, and the elimination of stop words. The outcomes of pre processing shown in Data imputation Data imputation is the process of handling missing values to ensure data completeness and consistency. Numerical values are filled with the mean of the respective column. The most common value ( mode ) is used in place of categorical values. This ensures that there are no missing values, making the dataset more reliable for analysis. 3. 3. 2. Confidence scoring Confidence scoring is used to measure the reliability of NLP-extracted insights by assigning scores between 0. 8 and 1. 0. Each row gets a random confidence score to reflect the accuracy of extracted textual information. Helps evaluate and filter uncertain results in pre dictive models. 3. 3. 3. Lemmatization The method of putting together the adjusted components of a word so that they are identifiable as one unit, is known as the word ’ s lemma or its vocabulary form. This procedure is identical to stemming, but it in corporates meaning into specific words. To put it simply, it links text with similar meanings to one word. Example : 1. Running : Run, 2. Fell : Overall proposed ModelFlow. C. Zheng 3 Fall, 3. Went : Go. 3. 3. 4. Stemming It is characterized as the procedure that generates variations of a base or root word. To put it simply, it cuts down a root word to its stem form. The stemming process is employed to reduce the length of the sentences and normalize them for improved comprehension. Example : For the base word \" like \" Stemming will comprise : Likes, liked, likely, and liking. 3. 3. 5.
