{"id":10,"text":"##N ) and distant metastasis ( pM ) shown in This staging is critical for treatment strategy decisions and was accurately categorized, reflecting the high capability of the AI system in handling complex staging data. Accuracy Assessment The overall extraction accuracy was evaluated rigorously, with a manual review process by specialists in breast can-cer pathology confirming the reliability of the AI-generated data. The AI prototype achieved an accuracy rate of 99. 61 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in processing and structuring complex pathological data. displays the accuracy heat map. These results, facilitated by the generative AI pro-totype, underscore the transformative potential of AI in the digital pathology landscape. Further analysis of the AI extraction system's perfor-mance revealed several areas where refinements could potentially elevate the system's accuracy to 100 %. Ambigu-ous descriptors such as \" 12 / 2 cm away from the nipple \" led to misinterpretations due to unclear nomenclature, possi-bly being misconstrued as a fraction rather than intended positional information. Additionally, expressions like \" The tumor is located at the upper central portion \" posed classifi-cation challenges, as'upper'and'central'were treated as dis-tinct categories, creating confusion. Moreover, the system's restricted selection for outputs resulted in misclassifications, such as labeling'adenocarcinoma'as'Invasive breast carci-noma of no special type'and similar mismatches in termi-nology like'micropapillary and cribriform.'Instances where accurately extracted terms, such as'DCIS does not involve the nipple epidermis,'were not selected in the output further highlight the necessity for an expanded, unrestricted output range. Addressing these issues by refining the system's inter-pretation and broadening the output parameters will pave the way for achieving a flawless 100 % accuracy rate in structur-ing pathology reports. Discussion The findings of this study emphasize the substantial capa-bilities of generative AI, particularly the integration of a GPT model with a Streamlit web application, in pars-ing and structuring complex free-text pathology reports related to breast cancer.
