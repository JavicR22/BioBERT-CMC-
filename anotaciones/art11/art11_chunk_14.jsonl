Conclusion This study demonstrates the potential of generative AI in extract-ing and structuring data from free-text breast cancer pathology reports. By integrating a GPT model with a Streamlit web application, we achieved a 99. 61 % accuracy rate in data pro-cessing, significantly outperforming traditional NLP methods. However, this exceptionally high accuracy is largely attributed to the study ’ s exclusive focus on breast cancer pathology reports, which inherently follow certain narrative patterns and include most elements required for structured reporting. We believe that large language models ( LLMs ) can streamline the structuring of unstructured pathology reports while improving data accessibility and interoperability, ulti-mately advancing medical research. Future studies should expand the dataset to encompass a broader range of medical conditions and explore the integration of multimodal AI models to further validate and refine the approach.","label":[[741,744,"MODEL"],[340,348,"METRIC"],[808,816,"METRIC"],[929,937,"METRIC"]],"Comments":[]}
