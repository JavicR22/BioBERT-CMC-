{"id":11,"text":"##formatics 2019, 20 ( Suppl 5 ) : 182 Page 263 of 264 for intensity ( +, −, etc ). Size ( scatter ) based gates are to be captured using a list of preferred terms. Population name is to be described using parent cell type in CL and additional markers or cell subtypes after an ‘ & ’ symbol. This standard has been tentatively approved by the HIPC steering committee, pending feedback from indi-vidual centers. There are a number of limitations to this study that we are aware of : The relationships between \" Population name \" and \" Gating definition \" are not abso-lute, for example if the input sample type is PBMC ver-sus splenocytes ( \" Population name \" ) with the same sorting definition ( \" Gating definition \" ) the outcome will be different cell types. This means that the validation cannot be expected to catch every potential error and fu-ture refinement may be possible after larger datasets are generated using these criteria. We also recognize that our approach is human-centric due to the focus of the HIPC projects, requiring further development if other species were to be included. We were also limited by the fact that that our dataset only had three phosphorylated STAT proteins, thus additional work needs to be done in order to accurately identify post-translational modifica-tions, which will be done in coordination with the PRO representation of such modifications. Lastly, and signifi-cantly, implementation of this validation into the Imm-Port submission templates is required if it is to be practical and easy for the HIPC community to utilize.
