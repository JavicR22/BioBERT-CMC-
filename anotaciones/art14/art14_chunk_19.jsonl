Recent studiesdemonstratethatLLMshavethepotentialtoaddressthischallenge26. Specifically, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Me-LLaMA on 70 challenging medical cases from the New England Journal of Medicine clinicopathologic conferences ( NEJM CPCs ) published between January 2021 and December 2022, as collected from an existing study27. The NEJM CPCs are well-known for their unique and intricate clinical cases, which have long been used as benchmarks for evaluating challenging medical scenarios. In line with previous research26, 27, we employed automatic eva-luations based on top-K ( where k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) accuracy, defined as the per-centage of cases where the correct diagnosis appeared within the top-K positions of the differential diagnosis list predicted by the assessed models.
