{"id":2,"text":"-marking in the biomedicine domain. To facilitate research on language representa-tions in the biomedicine domain, we present the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation ( BLUE ) benchmark, which consists of five dif-ferent biomedicine text-mining tasks with ten cor-pora. Here, we rely on preexisting datasets be-cause they have been widely used by the BioNLP community as shared tasks ( Huang and Lu, 2015 ). These tasks cover a diverse range of text genres ( biomedical literature and clinical notes ), dataset sizes, and degrees of difficulty and, more impor-tantly, highlight common biomedicine text-mining challenges. We expect that the models that per-form better on all or most tasks in BLUE will ad-dress other biomedicine tasks more robustly. To better understand the challenge posed by BLUE, we conduct experiments with two base-lines : One makes use of the BERT model ( Devlin, 2019 ) and one makes use of ELMo ( Peters, 2017 ). Both are state-of-the-art language representation models and demonstrate promising results in NLP tasks of general purpose. We find that the BERT model pre-trained on PubMed ab-stracts ( Fiorini, 2018 ) and MIMIC-III clini-cal notes ( Johnson, 2016 ) achieves the best results, and is significantly superior to other mod-els in the clinical domain. This demonstrates the importance of pre-training among different text genres. In summary, we offer : ( i ) five tasks with ten biomedical and clinical text-mining corpora with different sizes and levels of difficulty, ( ii ) codes for data construction and model evaluation for fair comparisons, ( iii ) pretrained BERT models on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III, and ( iv ) base-line results. 2 Related work There is a long history of using shared lan-guage representations to capture text semantics in biomedical text and data mining research. Such re-59 search utilizes a technique, termed transfer learn-ing, whereby the language representations are pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned in a variety of downstream tasks, such","label":[[874,878,"MODEL"],[1087,1091,"MODEL"],[1610,1614,"MODEL"],[1886,1900,"TECHNIQUE"],[1980,1990,"TECHNIQUE"],[184,193,"TECHNIQUE"],[1113,1119,"DATASET"],[1625,1631,"DATASET"],[1153,1162,"DATASET"],[1646,1655,"DATASET"],[1153,1159,"DATASET"],[1646,1652,"DATASET"]],"Comments":[]}
