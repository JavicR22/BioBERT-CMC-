ShARe / CLEF eHealth Task 1 Corpus is a col-lection of 299 deidentified clinical free-text notes from the MIMIC II database ( Suominen, 2013 ). 4 The disorders mentioned in the clini-cal notes were annotated by two professionally trained annotators, followed by an adjudication step, resulting in high inter-annotator agreement. We use the standard training and test set in the ShARe / CLEF eHealth Tasks 1. 3. 3 Relation extraction The aim of the relation extraction task is to pre-dict relations and their types between the two enti-ties mentioned in the sentences. The relations with types were compared to annotated data. We use the standard micro-average precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. DDI extraction 2013 corpus is a collection of 792 texts selected from the DrugBank database and other 233 Medline abstracts ( Herrero-Zazo, 2013 ). 5","label":[[338,341,"TECHNIQUE"],[403,406,"TECHNIQUE"],[466,469,"TECHNIQUE"],[517,536,"TECHNIQUE"],[598,617,"TECHNIQUE"],[678,697,"TECHNIQUE"],[1310,1329,"TECHNIQUE"],[1345,1364,"TECHNIQUE"],[744,767,"TECHNIQUE"],[828,836,"METRIC"],[1557,1566,"METRIC"],[1568,1574,"METRIC"],[1580,1588,"METRIC"],[537,545,"METRIC"],[618,626,"METRIC"],[1549,1566,"METRIC"],[1704,1711,"DATASET"],[644,648,"DATASET"]],"Comments":[]}
