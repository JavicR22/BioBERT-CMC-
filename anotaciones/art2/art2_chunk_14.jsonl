{"id":14,"text":"Conclusions To our knowledge, our study is the first to provide information regarding pulmonary nodule prevalence, characteristics, and FUP outcome over one year, in a European population. Another strength of this work lies on the innovative method using NLP algorithm, underlining the significant potential of this tool, its feasibility, and its relevance, in database analysis and medical research. There is a need for further studies, but our findings provide a use-ful overview of the situation, encouraging the implementation of IPN management program.
