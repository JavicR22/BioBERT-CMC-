In case of disagreement on a label, a review was performed in consensus. This labelled dataset was then randomly split in 90 % for training, 5 % for validation and 5 % for testing the two classifiers described below. A BERT-based NLP sentences classifier was built in two steps. First, an unsupervised fine-tuning of the network was performed for Cam-embert model using a Masked Language Model method on all the sentences extracted from the whole training dataset excepted these of the test dataset. Then, two classifiers were trained succes-sively on the manually labelled sentences. The first one aimed to clas-sify the reports ’ sentences into three categories ( ‘ Non-Thoracic \", \" Healthy Thoracic \" and \" Pathological Thoracic \" related sentences ), the second one to classify the reports ’ sentences into the pathological sub-categories. On the test dataset, the final accuracy of these two classifiers was 98. 6 % and 94. 7 % respectively. 2. 4. Application on our study population All CT performed during the year 2020 in our hospital were included in the analysis, regardless of the presence of chest explora-tion. The presence of a nodule was considered when one or more sen-tences within the same report ( in the findings and / or impression sec-tion ) were classified as \" Pulmonary micro-nodule \", \" Pulmonary nodule \", or \" Spiculated nodule \". We did not consider reports classi-fied as \" Pulmonary mass \",","label":[[645,649,"MODEL"],[728,739,"TECHNIQUE"],[1302,1310,"METRIC"]],"Comments":[]}
