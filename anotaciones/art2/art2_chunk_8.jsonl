{"id":8,"text":"This corresponds to 8108 patients. Among these, 1991 were IPN. All characteristics are figured in Mean nodule size was 8 mm ( SD § 5 mm ). 48 % of the nodules were 6 mm. 27 % of the patients had multiple nodules. Most nod-ules were solid ( 93 % ). 49 % of the nodules were mentioned in the impression part, whereas 51 % were only mentioned in the text body of the CT report. 21 % were related to COVID-19. 4. 2. Accuracy of the NLP algorithm to identify IPN in radiology reports A physician manually reviewed the radiology reports from a ran-dom sample of 475 patients. We compared these results ( considered as the reference ) to NLP detection of IPN ( We evaluated that the NLP sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were respectively 98 %, 99 % and 99 %. of the study.
