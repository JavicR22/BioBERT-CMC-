Follow-up Overall, 41 % of patients with IPN were followed up in our popula-tion ( Comparison between followed and unfollowed patients in univariate analysis In univariate analysis, patients belonging to the 50−75 years-old category were over-represented in the FUP group whereas the > 75 years-old category was under-represented ( Even if the difference is weak, nodules were significantly larger in the FUP group in comparison to the No FUP group ( 8. 1 mm vs 7. 5 mm respectively, p < 0. 001 ). Moreover, in the FUP group, 33 % and 21 % had nodules larger than 6 mm and 10 mm respectively, whereas it was only 29 % and 15 % in the No FUP group ( p < 0. 001 ). In addition, the proportion of reported nodules in the conclusion by the radiologist was significantly higher in the FUP group ( 57 % vs 43 %, p < 0. 001 ). COVID-19-related CT were under-represented in the FUP group in comparison to the No FUP group ( 15 % vs 24 %, p < 0. 001 ). Part-solid nodules were over-represented in the group of patients with FUP, but without reaching the significance level after Bonferroni correction ( 2. 85 % vs 1. 27 %, p = 0. 0489 ) 4. 5. Comparison between followed and unfollowed patients in multivariate analysis We performed a multivariate analysis to refine our model for assessing factors associated with the likelihood of patient FUP ( We selected the analysis parameters according to their clini-cal relevance. Among the included variables, being aged between 50 and 75 years-old ( OR = 1. 57, 95 % CI 1. 24−2, p < 0. 001 ) and the mention of the nodule in the impression section were significantly associated with FUP ( OR = 1. 45, 95 % CI 1. 19−1. 76, p < 0. 00","label":[],"Comments":[]}
