Open access best-performing model from the fivefold validation, and we used the cached model for subsequent evaluations. We used a test set comprising 30 annotated clinical notes to evaluate the models. These clinical notes were annotated with ground truth labels, serving as the refer-ence for evaluating the model ’ s predictions. We calcu-lated precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy and AUC for each trained model using the test set and used these performance metrics to assess the model ’ s performance. These metrics provide quantitative measures of the model ’ s performance and can aid in selecting the best performing model for the given classification task. The results can be found in where combination of text vectorisation and classification models were evalu-ated using specific metrics along with their 95 % CI. We measured the CI using the bootstrapping method, with 1000 iterations of sampling.
