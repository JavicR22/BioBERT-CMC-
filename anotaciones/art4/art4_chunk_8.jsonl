{"id":8,"text":"of smaller PLMs. As a more general issue, there lacks a deep, detailed investigation of the key factors that contribute to the superior abilities of LLMs. It is important to study when and how LLMs obtain such abilities. Although there are some meaningful discussions about this problem, more principled investigations are needed to uncover the \" secrets \" of LLMs. Secondly, it is difficult for the research community to train capable LLMs. Due to the huge de-mand of computation resources, it is very costly to carry out repetitive, ablating studies for investigating the effect of various strategies for training LLMs. Indeed, LLMs are mainly trained by industry, where many important training details ( e. g., data collection and cleaning ) are not revealed to the public. Thirdly, it is challenging to align LLMs with human values or p","label":[[807,812,"MODEL"]],"Comments":[]}
