{"id":15,"text":"Mutant 3. 0, MultiMutate, MUpro 2. 0. 4, SCide, Scpred, SRide 1784 mutations, of which 1154 destabilizing ( G 0. 5 kcal / mol ), 222 stabilizing ( G 0. 5 kcal / mol ), 631 neutral ( between −0. 5 and 0. 5 kcal / mol ), from 80 proteins from ProTherm database Ability to classify mutations into stabilizing ( G −0. 5 kcal / mol ), destabilizing ( G 0. 5 kcal / mol ) and neutral mutations ( −0. 5 kcal /-mol < G < 0. 5 kcal / mol ) Variability of G values in the database ( calculated with different experimental methods ) SCide, Scpred and SRide predict only destabilizing effects SCide, Scipred and SRide can predict only destabilizing mutations Overall performance : best for I-Mutant 3. 0, Dmutant and FoldX Best sensitivity for MUpro, I-Mutant 3. 0 and CUPSAT. Best specificity for SRide CUPSAT has the highest accuracy, sensitivity and MCC for stabilizing mutations. I-Mutant 3. 0, FoldX and Dmutant are the best methods for destabilizing mutations Authors of the assessment are not involved as co-authors of the programs assessed ∗The reader is recommended to refer to the original assessment article for further details.
