The authors reported a prediction error for FoldX below 0. 81 kcal mol−1 for 70 % of the point mutants included in a very large dataset, and after more than 15 years, this tool is still one of the most popular programs for this kind of application. Since then, a high number of programs have been developed to predict the G between a wild-type protein and its missense mutant ( s ) [ 18 – 66 ]. Tables 1 – 3 show a list of the tools developed or updated in the last 15 years and freely accessible via web servers, summarizing some of the properties of each tool. G predictions made by these tools are mainly based on two computational approaches. The first ( and generally oldest ) one calculates the free energy differences by classical equations and geometrical features, chemico-physical parameters or potential Three examples of protein stability expressed in form of G curve. The equilibrium between folded and unfolded state is described by the G curve. When the G has a positive value, the folded state is predominant. When the unfolded state is predominant, the curve has a negative G value. The G value at room temperature is indicated as the thermodynamic stability of the protein. The thermal stability is given by the Tm value. The Tm value indicates the melting temperature, i. e. the temperature value for which the folded and unfolded states are equally populated. For a given protein stability curve, two melting temperatures exist, also indicated as ‘ cold ’ and ‘ hot ’ melting points. The curves presented show some examples of how protein stability can be affected by an amino acid substitution. The wild-type protein stability is described by the continuous line, with thermal stability Tm1 and thermodynamic stability G1. The dotted curve shows one possible effect of a substitution : the thermodynamic stability is unchanged, while the thermal stability decreased to Tm2 value. The segmented curve shows another possible effect of a substitution : both the thermal and thermodynamic stability are decreased. As examples of other possible effects of the amino acid substitution ( not shown ), the curve may shift on the temperature axis, or may be flattened, or both, consequently the thermal and / or the thermodynamic stability may change. energy evaluations. Recently, two methods have been devel-oped for predicting changes in protein stabilities by modulat-ing charge – charge interactions, one","label":[[1625,1629,"TECHNIQUE"],[2110,2114,"TECHNIQUE"],[0,6,"TECHNOLOGY"]],"Comments":[]}
