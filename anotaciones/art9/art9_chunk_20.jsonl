In any case, the entity identification is a required step of the process that can be performed with the state-of-the-art methods that the researcher decides.

For each medical entity, the background knowledge includes all its labels, semantic types, definitions, and synonyms in other knowledge bases, such as DBpedia or Wikidata. These descriptions provide contextual information col-lected by the communities contributing to UMLS and the knowledge bases. Search engine : The medical entity linking system resorts to OpenSearch3 to search for background knowledge. OpenSearch relies on indexes and search methods and is able to scale to large knowledge bases. Query to be posted to the search engine. As we will see, experiments have been conducted to find the most appro-priate configuration of the search. The query may have the following configurable parameters : – k : It controls the number of candidates that the BK should return for a given medical entity. It is repre-sented by a natural number. – fuzziness : The degree of fuzziness or tolerance in matching concepts. 3 https : / / opensearch. org / 123 Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 63 : 749 – 772 759 NSSC flowchart : clinical note T with the set h∗, which is a set of normalized terms aligned to UMLS.
