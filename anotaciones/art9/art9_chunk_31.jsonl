{"id":31,"text":"up to the 15 best matches. The Multi _ match _ boosted method demon-strates an 77. 64 % accuracy rate for the top 15 terms, suggesting that while the single best term may not always be correct, expanding the search to the top 15 yields a much higher likelihood of retrieving the correct terms. Execution time ( s ) : Indicates the time spent in this initial phase of term retrieval. The exact method is the fastest, taking only 1. 72s, while the Multi _ match _ boosted method is the slowest, taking 137. 46s. The time is calculated as the sum of the duration required to search all the terms in the benchmark. The entity linking component, which is an integral part of the model ’ s output, includes a heuristic decision step. The effect of changing the threshold in the optimized module, as shown in when combined with the BK response, reveals changes in performance. In our benchmark, Breast-Norm-Benchmark, the optimal value for θopt is 0. 96. This means that the LLM will only be used if all candidates have less than 96 % similarity, or if there are candidates with more than 96 % similarity and more than one CUI. reports on the results observed by combin-ing medical entity linking and disambiguation when playing prompt engineering over LLMs with symbolic reasoning against the background knowledge.
