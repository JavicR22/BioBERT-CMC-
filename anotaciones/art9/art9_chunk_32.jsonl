However, a poor application of LLMs together with inappropriate prompts can drastically reduce the performance of the approach and increase the execution time. This is because the nature of the text in clinical notes differs significantly from the terms in UMLS. Forcing disambiguation on an LLM with a high tendency to hallucinate is worse than just getting the CUIs provided by the medical entity linking compo-nent. The best parameters for our case study are qtype : Multi _ match _ boosted, θsim : 0. 96, pLLM : CoT ( GPT4 ). These parameters were used for the rest of the validation study. 5. 2 Main results We present a comparative analysis of NSSC against scispaCy and BioFalcon, focusing specifically on its performance in terms of accuracy and execution time. The objective is to identify the most effective model for processing oncology clinical notes. The results are presented in Accu-racy @ 5is chosenbecausenoterminthebenchmarkhas more than five possible CUIs. The NSSC model clearly outperforms the baselines with an exemplary accuracy of 88. 34 %. This represents a consid-erable advance over the scispaCy models ( en _ core _ sci _ sm and en _ core _ sci _ lg ), which both hover around an accuracy of 28. 84 %, and the en _ core _ sci _ scibert variant at 30. 21 %. BioFalcon, while superior to scispaCy, still falls short with an accuracy of 55. 02 %. The execution time of the NSSC model, at 2502. 34s, is significantly higher than that of","label":[[1634,1641,"MODEL"],[1042,1050,"MODEL"],[1492,1500,"MODEL"],[1692,1700,"MODEL"],[353,367,"TECHNIQUE"],[771,785,"TECHNIQUE"],[15,23,"METRIC"],[1119,1127,"METRIC"],[1421,1429,"METRIC"],[1586,1594,"METRIC"],[1728,1736,"METRIC"]],"Comments":[]}
