to assess readability is the Flesch - Kincaid Reading Easeformula is represented in Eq., which evaluates sentence length and word complexity. Flesch −Kincaid Reading Ease = 206. 835 −1. 015 ( Total words Total sentence ) −84. 6 ( Total syllables Total words ) Where, Total words represents the no. of words in the text, total sentence is the no. of sentences in the text, and total syllables denotes the no. of syllables in the text. Lower scores ( nearer 0 ) denote that the text is more difficult, whereas higher scores ( nearer 100 ) indicate that the text is more diffi cult. The output of the readability score is depicted in Using a readability measure like the Flesch Reading Ease, the graph comparesthe readability of ChatGPT - 4 and Gemini for breast cancer reconstruction.
