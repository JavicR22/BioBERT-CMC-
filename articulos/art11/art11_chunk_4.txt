fluent responses, significantly enhancing usability compared to BERT ’ s more complex requirements for input tokenization and output handling. LLMs excel in understanding, inter - preting and generating text, which allows for precise extrac - tion and structuring of relevant information from free - text pathology reports. The advanced learning capabili - ties of GPT - 3. 5, supporting zero - shot and few - shot learning, empower it to quickly adapt to new tasks, a stark contrast to BERT, which necessitates detailed training with labeled data for most new tasks. This capability marks a significant advancement over previous AI models by standardizing data extraction processes, enhancing the accuracy of data analysis and enabling the integration of data from diverse sources. This study focuses on harnessing Generative AI to extract structured information from breast cancer free - text pathol - ogy reports, testing its efficacy in a tightly defined context to provide a robust foundation for broader applications. The research aims to overcome the limitations of prior DL and NLP approaches by demonstrating how Generative AI can revolutionize the analysis of pathological data, thereby enhancing research capabilities and improving patient care globally. Materials and Methods Data Collection The dataset comprises 33 anonymized breast cancer free - text pathology reports sourced from Taipei Medical University Hospital as one of them is illustrated in These reports, representative of a broad spectrum of breast cancer cases, were chosen to ensure a comprehen - sive analysis applicable to real - world clinical scenarios. The diversity of the dataset is crucial for the development of a robust AI model capable of accurately structuring and extracting information from free - text pathology reports. We acknowledge the concerns regarding the limited size of our dataset and its potential impact on the generalizability of our findings. To address these issues, we plan to explore opportunities to expand our dataset to include more diverse reports from multiple institutions. This will enable a more robust validation of our AI model ’ s capabilities across a Journal of Medical Systems 49 : 36 Page 3 of 16 36 broader clinical spectrum. Additionally, we will conduct statistical tests to assess the sufficiency of our sample size for capturing the complexity and variability of breast can - cer pathology reports. These evaluations will be aligned with established research methodologies and best practices in the field to ensure the reliability and applicability of our findings.
