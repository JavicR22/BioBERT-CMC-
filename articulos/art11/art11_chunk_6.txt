Integrated Development Environment Interface Initial Coding Step Libraries and API Journal of Medical Systems 49 : 36 Page 5 of 16 36 Prompt Engineering and Data Extraction The effectiveness of GPT - 3. 5 in our application is signifi - cantly enhanced by meticulous prompt engineering. This process involves the strategic formulation of input prompts to the model to optimize clarity and specificity in the infor - mation retrieval process. Through iterative refinements, these prompts are tailored to align closely with the idiosyn - cratic expressions and terminology of breast cancer pathol - ogy, which significantly contributes to the high accuracy rates observed. This method underscores the importance of model tuning and adaptation in leveraging generative AI effectively in specialized domains, which involves designing and refining inputs to the AI model to optimize output accu - racy for medical data extraction. This systematic approach is crucial due to the complexities and nuances of medical data. Each prompt is meticulously crafted and itera - tively refined based on performance feedback, ensuring high accuracy in extracting breast cancer - specific information according to ICCR protocols. In practice, our system utilizes a loop function to systematically issue these crafted prompts to the ChatGPT model via the OpenAI API. This function iterates over a sequence of structured prompts, each designed to extract specific pieces of medical information from the pathology reports. As each prompt is processed, the AI ’ s response is evaluated for accuracy and relevance. If the response fails to meet our strict accuracy thresholds or appears incomplete, the prompt is adjusted dynamically and re - submitted. This adaptive prompt engineering process ensures that the extracted information is both precise and comprehensive, adhering to established ICCR protocols for data integrity and reliability. The strategic use of this iterative loop mirrors methodologies discussed in which highlights the importance of tailored prompts in effectively extracting structured medical information using generative AI models.
