making the 13B models a practical alternative for broader accessibility. Notably, the Me - LLaMA 13B model achieves performance comparable to its 70B counterpart across most datasets, demonstrating its utility for diverse medical tasks in resource - limited settings. These features suggest that Me - LLaMA models could be explored for various medical applications. Potential areas of use include : clinical decision support, where these models might assist in analyzing patient records, generating differential diagnoses, and synthesizing medical literature to support evidence - based decision - making ; medical education, where chat - optimized versions could serve as interactive tools for teaching medical students and trainees by providing explanations for complex medical topics and simulating diagnostic reasoning ; and administrative tasks, where these models may help streamline workﬂows by summarizing clinical notes and generating discharge summaries, potentially reducing the doc - umentation burden on clinicians. Further research and evaluation are warranted to assess Me - LLaMA ’ s real - world effectiveness and limitations in these clinical application settings. Despite these advancements, it is crucial to acknowledge the current Me - LLaMA models still have certain limitations that require further attention. Like all existing LLMs, they are susceptible to generating infor - mation with factual errors or biased information. To mitigate this, future studies could incorporate methodologies like reinforcement learning from humanfeedback ( RLHF ) 17. Thisapproachcouldalignthemodels ’ responses more closely with human values and ensure they are grounded in factual medical knowledge. Another limitation is the current token handling capacity, capped at 4096 tokens, which is a constraint inherited from the backbone LLaMA2 model. Addressing this limitation could involve extending the models ’ capability to handle longer contexts. This could be achieved by integrating advanced attention techniques, such as sparse local attention18, that are able to handle extensive contexts. Additionally, while MIMIC is the largest publicly available EHR dataset, its size is still relatively small compared to other data sources, which The comparison of zero - shot performances among Me - LLaMA models and their backbone models LLaMA2 Dataset Metric LLaMA2 13B ( backbone ) Me - LLaMA 13B ( backbone + pre - train only ) LLaMA2 13B - instruct ( backbone + instruction tuning only ) Me - LLaMA - 13B - chat (
