We aimed to evaluate the number of incidental pulmonary nodules (IPN) found in 1 year in our hospital, as well as the follow-up (FUP) rate and the clinical and radiological features associated with FUP. Methods: We trained a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to identify the transcripts mentioning the presence of a pulmonary nodule, among a large population of patients from a French hospital. We extracted nodule characteristics using keyword analysis. NLP algorithm accuracy was determined through manual reading from a sample of our population. Electronic health database and medical record analysis by clinician allowed us to obtain information about FUP and cancer diagnoses. Results: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed 101,703 transcripts corresponding to the entire CTs performed in 2020. We identiﬁed 1,991 (2 %) patients with an IPN. NLP accuracy for nodule detec- tion in CT reports was 99 %. Only 41 % received a FUP between January 2020 and December 2021. Patient age, nodule size, and the mention of the nodule in the impression part were positively associated with FUP, while nodules diagnosed in the context of COVID-19 were less followed. 36 (2 %) lung cancers were subse- quently diagnosed, with 16 (45 %) at a non-metastatic stage. Conclusions: We identiﬁed a high prevalence of IPN with a low FUP rate, encouraging the implementation of IPN management program. We also highlighted the potential of NLP for database analysis in clinical research. © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Introduction Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, accounting for 18 % of all cancer related deaths . A recent French study highlighted that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is diagnosed at a metastatic stage in 60 % of the cases, thus preventing from the outset any curative intent . Studies on Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) have paved the way to earlier diagnosis and showed improvement in lung cancer outcomes [3−6]. However, pulmonary nodules are most often discovered inci- dentally, outside of LCS . These nodules, detected in patients with no history of cancer are called Incidental Pulmonary Nodules (IPN). An adequate management of IPN, supported by widely accepted recommendations, could lead to a stage shift from late to early-stage disease, and represent a great opportunity to improve lung cancer outcomes. But large population based studies are lack- ing and the literature is heterogeneous regarding adherence to FUP guidelines [8−12]. A better IPN related knowledge could allow us to evaluate the expected beneﬁts of organized programs of IPN Abbreviations: IPN, Incidental Pulmonary Nodule; FUP, Follow-Up; NLP, Natural Lan- guage Processing; BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers; HCL, Lyon University Hospital * Corresponding author.

Med and Res 86 101136 Available online at ScienceDirect www.sciencedirect.com management, as it has been suggested by the recent work of Osaro- giagbon . In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of IPN and related FUP outcomes in a large French hospital-based population, through Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)- based Natural Language Processing (NLP) detection of nodules in CT reports. NLP is a subset of computer sciences and artiﬁcial intelli- gence, using computational technique to learn, understand, and pro- duce human language content . The use of contextual embedding method allows to better understand the sentence’s meaning, and to study more complex concepts. Especially, BERT is a pre-trained NLP framework that has shown promising results on a variety of NLP tasks . Our primary endpoint was the assessment of IPN prevalence over one year and the associated FUP rate through healthcare database analysis. We also aimed to describe the main characteristics of IPN in our population and to assess factors associated with the occurrence of FUP. Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of our NLP algorithm through a manual review of radiology reports. This study was con- ducted during COVID-19 era. 2. Methods 2.1. Study population We retrospectively identiﬁed individuals who had at least one CT at Lyon University Hospital (HCL) during the period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. CT reports from 2019 were used to train and validate the NLP model. All the CT performed at HCL (regardless of the anatomical zone explored), from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, were included in our study. Radiology reports were semi- structured, with 4 sections, according to the European recommenda- tion . 2.2. Ethic The privacy policy of HCL has been respected. Patient data were considered as anonymous by our local ethic committee, therefore with no need of individual consent. The present study was registered at the «Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertes » (CNIL) under the number 21_5853. 2.3. NLP algorithm The NLP algorithm was trained to identify the reports describing the presence of a pulmonary nodule. To train our model, we ﬁrst extracted all the sentences from the “ﬁndings’’ section of each CT report of the 2019 training dataset. It resulted in 1,007,000 independent sentences. Among these senten- ces, 52,300 were randomly selected and labeled by a clinician and a radiologist according to their semantic meaning. The labels were ‘Non-Thoracic”, “Healthy Thoracic” and “Pathological Thoracic” related sentence. This latest category was then labeled according to the pathological feature described in the sentence: “Pulmonary embolism”, “Non-embolic pulmonary artery pathology”, “Heart abnormality”, “Mediastinal lymphadenopathy”, “Bronchial disor- ders”, “Interstitial syndrome”, “Pleural abnormality”, “Thoracic wall abnormality’, “Aortic dissection”, “Aortic aneurysm”, “Aortic Ather- oma”, “Aortic Ulceration”, “Congenital aortic pathology”, “Sub-clavic- ular artery or bronchial arteries disorder”, “Lung condensation”, “Post-surgical aspect”, “Pulmonary mass” (opacity 30 mm), “Pul- monary micro-nodule” (opacity < 3 mm), “Pulmonary interstitial micro-nodule” (micro-nodule with associated interstitial features), “Pulmonary nodule” (3−30 mm), “Intrapulmonary lymph node”, “Spiculated nodule”. In case of disagreement on a label, a review was performed in consensus. This labelled dataset was then randomly split in 90 % for training, 5 % for validation and 5 % for testing the two classiﬁers described below. A BERT-based NLP sentences classiﬁer was built in two steps. First, an unsupervised ﬁne-tuning of the network was performed for Cam- embert model using a Masked Language Model method on all the sentences extracted from the whole training dataset excepted these of the test dataset . Then, two classiﬁers were trained succes- sively on the manually labelled sentences. The ﬁrst one aimed to clas- sify the reports’ sentences into three categories (‘Non-Thoracic”, “Healthy Thoracic” and “Pathological Thoracic” related sentences), the second one to classify the reports’ sentences into the pathological sub-categories. On the test dataset, the ﬁnal accuracy of these two classiﬁers was 98.6 % and 94.7 % respectively. 2.4. Application on our study population All CT performed during the year 2020 in our hospital were included in the analysis, regardless of the presence of chest explora- tion. The presence of a nodule was considered when one or more sen- tences within the same report (in the ﬁndings and/or impression sec- tion) were classiﬁed as “Pulmonary micro-nodule”, “Pulmonary nodule”, or “Spiculated nodule”. We did not consider reports classi- ﬁed as “Pulmonary mass”, “Pulmonary interstitial micro-nodule”, “Intrapulmonary lymph node” or when no nodule was identiﬁed. The same NLP workﬂow was then applied on the impression sec- tion to determine whether the radiologist who originated the report mentioned the presence of a nodule in the conclusion. To evaluate the performance of the NLP algorithm we selected a random sample of 475 (0.5 %) patients from our study dataset . We compared the nodule identiﬁcation ﬁndings between NLP algo- rithm and physician review of reports. 2.5. Nodule characteristics We performed a keyword analysis using Microsoft Excel version “2206 Build 16.0.15330.2021600 on the text of the CT reports (all key- words are available in supplemental material, Table S1). According to this keyword analysis on the database of patients with a pulmonary nodule identiﬁed by the NLP algorithm, those with a history of cancer or nodule mentioned in their CT report were removed from the analysis. We determined if there was a mention of the nodule in the impression section, if the nodule was related to COVID-19, and its attenuation, through keyword analysis. We assumed that nodules with no speciﬁed attenuation were solids. We deﬁned a COVID-19 related CT as any CT performed in a context of microbiologically proven COVID-19, or suspected COVID-19. Nodule size and location were collected by manual review of all the reports with IPN. In case of multiple nodules, the size of the larg- est one was retained. In case of single nodule, we reported the lobe in which it was located. Multiple nodules were reported as such, with- out speciﬁcation of their location. 2.6. Follow-up (FUP) We used the international coding system for medical procedures and diagnoses ICD-10 (International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Dis- eases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision) to collect the infor- mation regarding patients’ FUP, from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. Information related to cancer diagnosis and common cancer diagnostic investigations were targeted. Information regarding the occurrence of chest CTs or consultations were also collected.We con- sidered as adequate FUP, a patient who received a chest CT and/or a E. Grolleau, S. Couraud, E. Jupin Delevaux Respiratory Medicine and Research 86 101136 2 consultation (in the pulmonology, thoracic surgery and/or radiation oncology departments) during the study period and after the nodule discovery. Other patients were considered as belonging to the No FUP group. Manual review of the patient’s medical records was per- formed for patients with a diagnosis of cancer. 3. Statistical analysis Analyses were performed using R, version “2022.02.1 + 46100 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We utilized a Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple testing, separately for the two sets of comparisons after which p-values 0.006 (for univar- iate) and p-values 0.004 (for multivariate) were considered as sta- tistically signiﬁcant. Continuous variables were reported as mean with standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables as count with percentages and their 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CI95 %). Variables of interest were compared between the FUP group and the No FUP group, using x2 test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney U test test for continuous variables that did not have a nor- mal distribution according to Shapiro test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the independent variables and the follow up, using “glm” function and “forrestmodel” package. New categorical variables were created from quantitative variables. Cutoff were chosen for their clinical relevance. Missing data were reported as such and included as a value of the concerned variables in the multivariate analysis. Only relevant variables, statisti- cally signiﬁcant in univariate analysis, were included in the multivar- iate analysis. Interactions and multicollinearity were systematically evaluated. 4. Results 4.1. Population and nodule characteristics The NLP algorithm identiﬁed 15,996 (16 %) positive nodule cases during the study period, out of the 101,703 CT performed in HCL in 2020 ( This corresponds to 8108 patients. Among these, 1991 were IPN. All characteristics are ﬁgured in Mean nodule size was 8 mm (SD § 5 mm). 48 % of the nodules were 6 mm. 27 % of the patients had multiple nodules. Most nod- ules were solid (93 %). 49 % of the nodules were mentioned in the impression part, whereas 51 % were only mentioned in the text body of the CT report. 21 % were related to COVID-19. 4.2. Accuracy of the NLP algorithm to identify IPN in radiology reports A physician manually reviewed the radiology reports from a ran- dom sample of 475 patients. We compared these results (considered as the reference) to NLP detection of IPN ( We evaluated that the NLP sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and accuracy were respectively 98 %, 99 % and 99 %. of the study.

Follow-up Overall, 41 % of patients with IPN were followed up in our popula- tion ( Comparison between followed and unfollowed patients in univariate analysis In univariate analysis, patients belonging to the 50−75 years-old category were over-represented in the FUP group whereas the > 75 years-old category was under-represented ( Even if the difference is weak, nodules were signiﬁcantly larger in the FUP group in comparison to the No FUP group (8.1 mm vs 7.5 mm respectively, p < 0.001). Moreover, in the FUP group, 33 % and 21 % had nodules larger than 6 mm and 10 mm respectively, whereas it was only 29 % and 15 % in the No FUP group (p < 0.001). In addition, the proportion of reported nodules in the conclusion by the radiologist was signiﬁcantly higher in the FUP group (57% vs 43 %, p < 0.001). COVID-19-related CT were under-represented in the FUP group in comparison to the No FUP group (15% vs 24 %, p < 0.001). Part-solid nodules were over-represented in the group of patients with FUP, but without reaching the signiﬁcance level after Bonferroni correction (2.85% vs 1.27 %, p = 0.0489) 4.5. Comparison between followed and unfollowed patients in multivariate analysis We performed a multivariate analysis to reﬁne our model for assessing factors associated with the likelihood of patient FUP ( We selected the analysis parameters according to their clini- cal relevance. Among the included variables, being aged between 50 and 75 years-old (OR = 1.57, 95 %CI 1.24−2, p < 0.001) and the mention of the nodule in the impression section were signiﬁcantly associated with FUP (OR = 1.45, 95 %CI 1.19−1.76, p < 0.001). Marginally signiﬁ- cant association between nodule size (>10 mm) and FUP was observed (OR = 1.53, 95 %CI 1.14−2.05, p = 0.004). In contrary, CT per- formed in a context of COVID-19 were associated with a lower pro- portion of FUP (OR = 0.62, 95 %CI 0.49−0.79, p < 0.001). Patients over 75 years-old were less likely to be followed, although the threshold for signiﬁcance was not reached (OR = 0.75, 95 %CI 0.57−0.98, p < 0.033). Other variables were not signiﬁcantly associated with the likelihood of FUP in our model. 4.6. Cancer In our population, we identiﬁed 127 cancer cases ( Lung cancer diagnosis was more frequent among patients with a FUP in comparison to their counterpart (37 % and 10 % respectively). Detailed characteristics of patients with a cancer diagnosis are avail- able in Among lung cancer patients, 44 % were diagnosed with a lung adenocarcinoma, 33 % with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 11 % with a small cell lung cancer and 11 % with other histological types ( Sixteen (44 %) were diagnosed at a non-metastatic stage ( Discussion We trained a BERT-based NLP algorithm to detect pulmonary nod- ules on CT reports and demonstrated its high accuracy in processing a large database with 98 % sensitivity and 99 % speciﬁcity. The perfor- mance of our NLP tool is comparable to those reported in previously published works [19−21]. IPN prevalence was 2 % among all CT reports of 2020, with a FUP rate of 41 % in the study period. Patient age, nodule size and the mention of the nodule in the impression part were signiﬁcantly associated with FUP in multivariate analysis, while nodules related to COVID-19 were less followed. IPN prevalence in the European population is poorly known. In the literature, this prevalence depends on the CT type, ranging from <10 % for abdominal CT, to almost 50 % for chest CT angiograms . The FUP rate of IPN was yet not really explored. With our NLP- based detection method coupled with healthcare software database interrogation, we obtained a FUP rate of 41 %. When considering only the nodules 6 mm, the FUP rate increased to 45 %. Blagev and col- leagues reported that 29 % of IPN discovery led to further evaluation when nodules were discovered in pulmonary angiograms, especially Performance of our NLP algorithm to identify IPN on the study dataset.

Iqbal studied the impact of the terminology used by radiologists to report IPN on FUP. They showed that only 41 % of the nodules resulted in a subsequent FUP . In a retrospective cohort study using NLP to identify nodules in CT reports, Lee reported that 61 % of the patients were followed. Among patients with inadequate FUP a majority had delayed surveillance . We did not study here the adequacy between timely recommended FUP and actual work-up. In this work, we highlighted different factors associated with patient FUP. A Higher FUP rate was observed in the 50−75 years-old group whereas older patients are under-represented in the FUP group ( This trend might be driven by the lower comparison of patients’ and nodules’ characteristics in univariate analysis, between the followed and unfollowed patients.

The context of LCS implementation might have also favored the over-representation of 50−75 years-old patients in the FUP popula- tion . A signiﬁcantly higher rate of FUP was associated with the mention of the nodule in the conclusion ( This observation had already been made by Blagev in their review of 1000 CT pulmo- nary angiography . Finally, COVID-19 associated CT were less likely to be followed, according to univariate and multivariate analyses. A possible explanation is that the French healthcare system has been heavily affected by the pandemic, and many scheduled consultations, surgeries, and imaging procedures were delayed . In our population, 36 lung cancers were diagnosed, representing around 2 % of IPN, with a substantial proportion (45 %) of non-meta- static stage, allowing to consider a curative therapy. Overall, IPN is a frequent ﬁnding, not enough monitored . Several avenues for improvement can be further explored: ﬁrstly, a structured reporting and the mention of the IPN in the impression part by the radiologist seem very important . Secondly, facilitating the communication between radiologist and care providers could lead to substantial improvement in the FUP rate: NLP tool allowing to extract the radiologist recommendation from the CT report, patient tracking system, or NLP-based generation of FUP recommendations from the CT reports have been reported . Finally, the care- giver in charge of the patient at the time of nodule discovery is often limited by time, knowledge, and resources in providing the preferred level of care. This could be addressed by the development of lung nodule surveillance programs . Our conclusions must be interpreted with some limitations: patient’s FUP was considered only within our institution, and we did not consider the external FUP of the patients. Under-estimation of the FUP rate might have been favored by the FUP of some nodules in non-specialized medical departments, not included in our analysis. Misclassiﬁcation of nodules might have occurred because of incor- rectly reported CT scan indication. Even if our NLP tool was not sup- posed to retain benign nodules, we did not evaluate its accuracy to discriminate this nodule subclass. 6. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to provide information regarding pulmonary nodule prevalence, characteristics, and FUP outcome over one year, in a European population. Another strength of this work lies on the innovative method using NLP algorithm, underlining the signiﬁcant potential of this tool, its feasibility, and its relevance, in database analysis and medical research. There is a need for further studies, but our ﬁndings provide a use- ful overview of the situation, encouraging the implementation of IPN management program.
