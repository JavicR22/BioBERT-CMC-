With the progress in natural language processing ( NLP ), extracting valuable information from bio - medical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of ef - fective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text min - ing often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre - trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results : We introduce BioBERT ( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining ), which is a domain - speciﬁc language representation model pre - trained on large - scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state - of - the - art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre - trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state - of - the - art models, BioBERT signiﬁcantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks : biomedical named entity recognition ( 0. 62 % F1 score improvement ), bio
