Based on this, we have identified a number of marker synonyms, pro - tein complexes, and non - marker based gates, and logical cell definitions that we are submitting to the appropriate ontologies ( PRO, Gene Ontology ( GO ), CL and OBI ) to further improve such mappings in the future. We have also developed a tentative standard on how to submit gating definitions and cell population names in the future that could be checked for validity and consistency in a fully automated fashion. This standard consists of describing gating definitions by utilizing comma separated PRO terms combined with symbols Automated cell field validator. The validator takes a cell type and gating definition as an input, extracts the logical axioms associated with them, and checks for conflicts which are highlighted in red Protein Ontology short labels accounted for the majority of gate name matches in our dataset with the majority being not matched.
