Using clinical decision support systems ( CDSSs ) for breast cancer management necessitates to extract relevant patient data from textual reports which is a complex task although efficiently achieved by machine learning but black box methods. We proposed a rule - based natural language processing ( NLP ) method to automate the translation of breast cancer patient summaries into structured patient profiles suitable for input into the guideline - based CDSS of the DESIREE project. Our method encompasses named entity recognition ( NER ), relation extraction and structured data extraction to systematically organize patient data. The method demonstrated strong alignment with treatment recommendations generated for manually created patient profiles ( gold standard ) with only 2 % of differences. Moreover, the NER pipeline achieved an average F1 - score of 0. 9 across the main entities ( patient, side, and tumor ), of 0, 87 for relation extraction, and 0. 75 for contextual information, showing promising results for rule - based NLP.

Introduction Multidisciplinary tumor boards ( MTBs ) are pivotal in fostering collaborative decision - making in breast cancer management, yet their effectiveness is under scrutiny amidst challenges of staffing shortages and increased workload. In recent years, clinical decision support systems ( CDSSs ) have emerged as promising computer - based tools to leverage patient - specific data and provide personalized treatment strategies. DESIREE is a European project that focused on developing a multimodal CDSS for primary breast cancer patient management
