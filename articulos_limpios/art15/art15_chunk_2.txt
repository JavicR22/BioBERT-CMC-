However, DESIREE didn ’ t tackle interoperability issues with electronic health records ( EHRs ) and health professionals had to manually input patient data, which is time - consuming and prone to errors. Given that about 80 % of EHR data is in textual format, integrating the GL - DSS with EHRs necessitates the utilization of natural language processing ( NLP ) methods to enable the automated extraction of relevant information from textual data. In recent years, NLP techniques have shifted from rule - based to machine learning ( ML ) methods that have proven to be more effective. While ML methods offer efficiency, they raise concerns about environmental impact and explainability issues, making rule - based approaches, less data - intensive and more explainable, attractive again. In this paper, we present a rule - based NLP approach, allowing the automatic creation of structured patient profiles from breast cancer patient summaries ( BCPSs ) to be input to the GL - DSS. 2. Methods 2. 1. BCPSs and structured data representation BCPSs are textual documents providing the information necessary for making breast cancer therapeutic decisions, including personal and family histories, disease history, clinical examination findings, tumor characteristics, radiology, and pathology results, TNM classification, and care plan proposals. We worked on BCPSs sourced from APHP - EDS, the data warehouse of AP - HP University hospitals in Paris, France. The BCKM ontology is structured to replicate the entity - attribute - value ( EAV ) generic model for data modeling and the integration of concepts related to the breast cancer domain, based on three main entities, the patient, the breast side
