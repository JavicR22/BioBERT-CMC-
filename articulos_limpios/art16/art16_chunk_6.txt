The drug - drug interactions, includ - ing both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, were annotated by two expert phar - macists with a substantial background in pharma - covigilance. In our benchmark, we use 624 train ﬁles and 191 test ﬁles to evaluate the performance and report the micro - average F1 - score of the four DDI types. ChemProt consists of 1, 820 PubMed abstracts with chemical - protein interactions annotated by domain experts and was used in the BioCre - ative VI text mining chemical - protein interactions shared task ( Krallinger, 2017 ). 6 We use the 4https : / / physionet. org / works / ShAReCLEFeHealth2013 / 5http : / / labda. inf. uc3m. es / ddicorpus 6https : / / biocreative. bioinformatics. udel. edu / news / corpora / standard training and test sets in the ChemProt shared task and evaluate the same ﬁve classes : CPR : 3, CPR : 4, CPR : 5, CPR : 6, and CPR : 9. i2b2 2010 shared task collection consists of 170 documents for training and 256 documents for testing, which is the subset of the original dataset ( Uzuner, 2011 ). 7 The dataset was collected from three different hospitals and was annotated by medical practitioners for eight types of relations between problems and treatments. 3. 4 Document multilabel classiﬁcation The multilabel classiﬁcation task predicts multiple labels from the texts. HoC ( the Hallmarks of Cancers corpus ) con - sists of 1, 580 PubMed abstracts annotated with ten currently known hallmarks of cancer ( Baker, 2016 ). 8 Annotation was performed at sentence level by an expert with 15 + years of experience in cancer research. We use 315 ( % ) abstracts for testing and the remaining abstracts for train - ing. For the HoC task, we followed the common practice and reported the example - based F1 - score on the abstract level ( Zhang and Zhou, 2014 ; Du, 2019 ). 3. 5 Inference task The aim of the inference task is to predict whether
