Open access groups in the USA, but disparities exist in outcomes. 2 While white women have higher incidence rates, black and Hispanic women face higher mortality rates. 3 4 Addi - tionally, the incidence is increasing rapidly among Asian / Pacific Islanders and American Indian / Alaska Natives. 4 The widespread adoption of electronic health records ( EHRs ) offers promising opportunities for predicting future events using large amounts of data. 5 Especially, unstructured clinical notes contain important informa - tion often not captured in structured, coded formats. 6 For example, patient - reported outcomes from patients with cancer are often not captured in structured EHRs, but is increasingly found in unstructured or semi - structured text formats within EHRs, facilitating translational research and personalised care. 7 – 9 One common approach in clinical text analysis involves using a rule - based natural language processing ( NLP ) algorithm that leverages distinct medical keywords from clinical texts. 10 11 Specifically, with the advance - ments in neural language modelling, integrating neural networks with features extracted from this rule - based NLP method can be achieved by using word embedding models for feature extraction. 12 This approach allows for building a fully neural network - based pipeline that combines embedding models with supervised learning algorithms. 13 In cancer research, incorporating clinical notes into analyses
