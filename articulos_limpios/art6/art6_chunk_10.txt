lung cancer. Additionally, the presence of an ‘ existing disorder of the lung ’ was found to positively impact the prediction. Notably, individuals of white ethnicity had the greatest influence on the model outputs, increas ing the SHAP value towards the prediction of lung can cer, although all ethnicities displayed varying degrees of impact toward a positive diagnosis. Males had an increased SHAP value, contributing to the prediction. Conversely, the presence of a ‘ congenital anomaly of a great vessel ’ and ‘ disorders of the retroperitoneal com partment ’ reduced the SHAP value. Context - dependent factors, such as pain, bleeding, and arthropathy, also reduced the SHAP value, making a prediction of lung cancer less likely. Finally, the presence of a cough was found to increase the SHAP value, further emphasising its relevance in the prediction of lung cancer. Due to the relevancy of ethnicity variables ranking highly in terms of feature importance, an additional anal ysis was carried out to understand how performance may fluctuate regarding different ethnic groups.
