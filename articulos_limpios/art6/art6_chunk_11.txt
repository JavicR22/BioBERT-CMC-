Given the high - level nature of several the features, due to the subsumption process applied, an exploration into what symptoms or co - morbidities comprised such fea tures was performed. shows each of the selected features, and some of the most prominent features which comprise them. Comparison of the proposed approach with other cancer risk tools shows the receiver operating characteris tic curve of the model produced using the methods described in this paper, the QCancer score, and the lung cancer related risk assessment tools listed on the Cancer Research UK website. As previ ously reported, the proposed methods resulted in an AUROC of 0. 72. The application of the QCancer calcula tor to the test set used throughout this paper resulted in an AUROC of 0. 67 and the
