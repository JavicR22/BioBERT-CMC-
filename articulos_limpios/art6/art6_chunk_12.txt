Shading of each datapoint indicates the value of the feature. For all binary features, except age, a red value denotes a “ true ” value and blue denotes a false value. For age, the bluer a datapoint reflect a younger age, and the redder a data point, the older the patient Page 7 of 10 Houston BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 24 : 371 approach significantly improved upon the QCancer score ( p = 0. 015 ) and Hamilton ( p < 0. 001 ). Discussion This work aimed to explore the use of NLP for the extrac tion of SNOMED - CT concepts from unstructured clini cal free - text, coupled with subsumption techniques to address the challenges posed by sparse features in high - dimensional datasets. Leveraging genetic optimisation and machine learning, the generated dataset was used to develop a predictive model for lung cancer diagnosis. Model development resulted in a classifier with stable performance characterised by low standard deviations between the cross - validation folds and an AUROC of 0. 72. Additionally, the model offers a balanced trade - off between sensitivity and specificity with values of 0. 69 and 0. 66, respectively. Notably, our proposed methodol ogy outperforms both the QCancer calculator and the methods introduced by Hamilton, highlighting the promise NLP and machine learning approaches could have for the curation of rich datasets and the development of robust predictive models in the field of lung cancer risk assessment.
