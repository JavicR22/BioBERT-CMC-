##rich KGs. We have developed two workﬂows : one for re - curating a given KG to assure its syntactic and semantic quality and another for rationally enriching it by manually revising automatically extracted relations for nodes with low information density. We applied these workﬂows to the KGs encoded in Biological Expression Language from the NeuroMMSig database using content that was pre - extracted from MEDLINE abstracts and PubMed Central full - text articles using text mining output integrated by INDRA. We have made this workﬂow freely available at https : / / github. com / bel - enrichment / bel - enrichment. Database URL : https : / / github. com / bel - enrichment / results Background The rapid accumulation of unstructured knowledge in the biomedical literature has motivated its structuring and formalization so computers can assist in large - scale reasoning and interpretation. Several standard formats have been proposed for storing newly structured knowledge, including Systems Biology Markup Language [ SBML ; ], Biological Pathways Exchange Language [ BioPAX ; ], Downloaded from https : / / academic. oup. com / database / article / doi / 10. 1093 / database / baz068 / 5521414 by guest on 30 October 2025 Page 2 of 13 Database, Vol. 2019, Article ID baz068 Biological Expression Language [ BEL ; ] and Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models. Accompanying these standards are public repositories containing content generated both in academic and industrial contexts such as the BioModels Database, Pathway Commons, NDEx, Bio2RDF, Open PHACTS and BEL Commons. Even though each standard focuses on different aspects of modeling knowledge in systems and networks biology, they all give rise to knowledge graphs ( KGs ) consisting of biological entities ( nodes ), their interrelations ( edges ) and their associated metadata. While KGs have been useful for qualitative modeling of biochemical networks, cellular signaling ( 13 – 15 ), gene regulatory pathways and genetic interactions, metabolic pathways and other systems biology applications, there are several challenges associated with their use. First, they contain noise arising from curation, from the loss of information due to representation and from normalization of different knowledge
