Ultimately, as automated relation extraction technolo - gies improve, they will be used to more significantly sup - plement manual curation efforts. We expect to see many upcoming workflows leveraging these exciting prospects. Authors ’ contributions C. T. H. and D. D. F. conceived and designed the study and authored this manuscript. C. T. H., D.
