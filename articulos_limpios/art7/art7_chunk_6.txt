##cm. com ), GitHub ( https : / / github. com ), PyBEL and a novel PyBEL extension PyBEL - Git in order to identify and address syntactical issues in the BEL documents generated during the AETIONOMY project [ https : / / www. aetionomy. eu ; ( 40 – 44 ) and exposed through the NeuroMMSig mechanism enrichment server. This workflow can be implemented in other web - based version control systems such as GitLab ( https : / / gitlab. com ) and Atlassian BitBucket ( https : / / bitbucket. org ) as well as directly integrated with continuous integration systems such as GitLab CI / CD ( https : / / docs. gitlab. com / ee / ci ), Travis - CI ( https : / / travis - ci. com ) and BitBucket Pipelines ( https : / / bitbucket. org / product / features / pipelines ) using the instructions provided at https : / / github. com / pybel / pybel - git with minimal configuration. Semantic quality assurance We selected 10 signatures ( and their corresponding BEL documents ) from NeuroMMSig based on their druggability ( number of proteins targeted by drugs that have been assessed in clinical trials ), their novelty ( less preference given to subgraphs corresponding to hypotheses that have repeatedly failed in the clinic, namely amyloid - beta aggrega - tion ) and their amenability to assay development ( based on expert advice ) as an example for the re - curation workflow outlined below. An enumeration and statistics can be found in and the signatures can be explored through BEL Commons. Because BEL was developed by the biomarker discovery company Selventa before the wide adoption of semantic resources like Identifiers. org, the Open Biomedical Ontology Foundry and the OLS, the language used a custom format for storing the names and identifiers of entities in major biomedical databases and ontologies such as the HUGO Genome Nomenclature Consortium [ HGNC ; ], Chemical Entities of Biological Interest [ ChEBI ; ], the Gene Ontology [ GO ;
