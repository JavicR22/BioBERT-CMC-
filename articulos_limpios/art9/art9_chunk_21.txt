BK ) is searched to identify candidates for links in UMLS. In case disambiguation is required, semantic information from the candidate terms is used for Chain of Thoughts ( CoT ) prompting over an LLM * Exact : This method is strictly an exact match. Only results that exactly match the query con - cepts in the BK. * Basic fuzzy : This method uses basic fuzzy matching, allowing for slight variations in the query terms. 123 760 Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 63 : 749 – 772 * Multi - match : This query method represents the highest level of fuzziness. – lang : The language of the terms is saved. * SPA : Spanish language. * ENG : English language. – boost words : Keywords that receive a boost in rele - vance. Similarity function in the optimization module : It deter - mines the relationship between the vocabulary term and a medical entity. Algorithm 2 is a sketch of the algorithm implemented for the medical entity linking system. When the results are retrieved from the search engine, they are ranked according to their relevance to the query. Each result is assigned a rel - evance score based on how well it matches the search query. With all of the results, we have a set of candidates that could be used directly as input to query the LLM. The result of the search will be a set of candidates ( te ) along with the ranking value.
