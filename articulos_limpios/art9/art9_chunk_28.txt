. com / SDM - TIB / NSSC. The experiments are executed in an Intel Core i9 - 7900X CPU with a clock speed of 3. 30 GHz, equipped with 20 CPU cores, organized into 10 cores per socket, each supporting 2 threads per core. The CPU architecture was identiﬁed as x86 _ 64. The RAM consisted of 4 x 16GiB DDR4 synchronous modules, each running at 2133 MHz. The O. S. is Linux with kernel version 5. 15. 0 - 83 - generic, based on Ubuntu 20. 04. 1 LTS. Metrics The performance of NSSC is measured in terms of accuracy. We use this metric because an entity can have more than one valid CUI in UMLS ( e. g., the 7 https : / / spacy. io / 123 764 Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 63 : 749 – 772 Support of the annotated labels of the corpus Label ( le ) Support # Tokens Cancer concept 826 845 Cancer type 558 578 Cancer subtype 75 102 Cancer expansion 650 702 Cancer location 1645 2809 Cancer metastasis 369 388 Cancer recurrence 44 44 Molecular marker 1691 4346 Cancer stage 344 694 TNM 594 2176 Treatment name 351 444 Treatment schema 96 104 Treatment drug 475 487 Treatment frequency 43 54 Treatment quantity 56 101 Surgery 888 1259 Total 8600 15, 031 entity “ chemotherapy ” can be valid with the following CUIs : “ C0013216, ” “ C3665472, ” “ C1571591 ” ). This met - ric focuses on the proportion of correct ( gold ) values that the system also identiﬁed. Accuracy = | G ∩R | | G | where : G = set of gold ( correct ) values R = set of outputs by NSSC. Furthermore, we use Accuracy @ N ( Eq. 4 ) to allow com - parison with other systems, as classical methods cannot retrieve the best CUIs and are limited to providing a top - N set of results. Accuracy @ N = G ∩Rtop - N | G | where : Validation benchmark Context ( le ) Support # Token
