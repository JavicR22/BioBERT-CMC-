This execution time represents how much it takes to normalize the full benchmark 123 Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 63 : 749 – 772 767 datasets allows it to ﬁne - tune entity identiﬁcation and link - ing for different diseases, enhancing its versatility in clinical text processing. This feature makes NSSC a valuable asset for advancing information extraction across the healthcare landscape. The time complexity of the algorithm is higher than other approaches that do not use LLMs, because models like GPT - 4 are signiﬁcantly more expensive than smaller domain - speciﬁc models due to the large number of parameters, which are in the order of billions. However, the approach is opti - mized to avoid using the LLM in every case, making it more efﬁcient. In addition, the use of the LLM allows the approach to be generalized to other domains. NSSC uses contextual information as a critical input for understanding disease entities in clinical notes. Different diseases require different levels of context sensitivity ; for example, oncology entities often require a nuanced under - standing of dependencies, while simpler diseases may beneﬁt from less detailed contextual analysis. Future enhancements shouldincludedisease - speciﬁccontextualknowledge, allow - ing the model to adjust its context sensitivity based on the unique characteristics of each disease. This extension will ensure that the approach remains tailored to the nuances of different medical conditions, optimizing performance across a range of
