cally requires signiﬁcant computational resources and large annotated datasets. The cost of acquiring and preprocess - ing such datasets, coupled with the computational demands during training, can be challenging, especially in resource - constrained environments. Future research should focus on reducing training costs and optimizing model architectures for resource - constrained environments. These efforts will improve the accessibility and adoption of our framework. In addition, future research should prioritize improving disease - speciﬁc contextual adaptability. In this way, NSSC contributes to ongoing efforts to harness the power of AI to transform medical information extraction for improved patient care and medical research. Appendix A. Prompt costs We use models gpt - 3. 5 - turbo and gpt - 4 though Microsoft Azure. To establish a connection with the Ope - nAI API, we utilize the Azure endpoint. The price of this API depends on the model, and there are different prices for the input tokens and the output tokens, as detailed in https : / / azure. microsoft. com / en - us / pricing / details / cognitive - services / openai - service /. 123 768 Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 63 : 749 – 772 Funding This article is supported by the European Union ’ s Hori - zon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 875160, project CLARIFY.
